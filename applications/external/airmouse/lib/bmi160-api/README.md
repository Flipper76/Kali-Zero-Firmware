# BMI160 Sensor API

### Sensor overview

The small, low power BMI160 is a low noise 16-bit IMU designed for mobile applications such as AR or indoor navigation, providing highly accurate sensor data and real-time sensor data. The low current consumption of BMI160 enables always-on applications in battery-driven devices. This sensor features a configurable on-chip interrupt engine which provides motion-based gesture recognition and context awareness as always-on background functions.

### Target Application
- Augmented reality and immersive gaming
- Indoor navigation
- 3D-scanning / indoor mapping
- Advanced gesture recognition
- Immersive gaming
- 9-axis motion detection
- Air mouse applications and pointers
- Pedometer / step counting
- Advanced system power management for mobile applications
- Optical image stabilization of camera modules
- Free-fall detection and warranty logging
