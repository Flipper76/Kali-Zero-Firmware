Render your responsive images using <picture>, with the original asset used as a fallback. Note: If your original assets are not web-friendly (e.g. they are very large), you can use a resized image as the fallback instead. See the srcset-resized-fallback.html template for how to do this.

Usage:

	{% responsive_image path: assets/image.jpg alt: "A description of the image" %}

(P.S. You can safely delete this comment block)

<picture>
    {% for i in resized %}
        <source media="(min-width: {{ i.width }}px)" srcset="/{{ i.path }}">
    {% endfor %}
    <img src="/{{ path }}">
</picture>
