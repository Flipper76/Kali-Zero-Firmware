# Dolphin counter

This is a simple plugin for the [Flipper Zero](https://www.flipperzero.one).
It gives you access to a counter which you can increment and decrement using the up and down buttons respectively.
Long-pressing the OK button will enable vibro feedback for adding, and long-pressing the back button will clear the counter.

# How to install this?

The easiest way is to download the `counter.fap` file from `dist`, and place it inside of the `apps` folder on the SD card of your Flipper Zero device.

For developoment, I'd recommend using [flipperzero-ufbt](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt), which is a lightweight tool for quickly building and testing Flipper Zero applications.
