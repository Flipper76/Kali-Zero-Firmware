# Cyborg Detector

## How it works

Run the app and move the Flipper Zero over implants or other LED equipped NFC tags and the light will glow.

## ToDo:

- Feedback showing when a cyborg is detected.
- Switch between NFC and RFID detection.
- Possibly display dynamic chip data as found without stopping. Screen to update only when new data is found.
