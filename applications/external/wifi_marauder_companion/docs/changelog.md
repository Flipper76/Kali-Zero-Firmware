## v0.7.0

Unified serial update! No more complicated wiring of 2x UART connections - all your boards are supported now, with PCAPs and text both going over just ONE, SINGLE serial channel! Thanks to @Willy-JL for adding this amazing feature and fixing up the app for the new APIs.

Requires Marauder **FW v0.13.7** (or newer) flashed to your wifi board: https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/releases/latest

## v0.6.6

Bug fixes and new BLE spam commands! Thanks to @justcallmekoko for adding the new commands! I also fixed the script user input bug where it would hang after selecting "save".

The BLE spam command format has changed and requires at least **FW v0.13.6**. Make sure you flash the latest release of Marauder FW to your wifi board: https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/releases/latest

Note: if you're flashing directly from your flipper using the [ESP Flasher app](https://github.com/0xchocolate/flipperzero-esp-flasher), grab the bin that corresponds to your hardware and only reflash the Firmware partition. (If you have dual boot set up, then choose the slot where you want to install it. Otherwise, reflash FirmwareA only.)

By the way, want to support app development by buying me a coffee? You finally have that option! https://ko-fi.com/cococode
