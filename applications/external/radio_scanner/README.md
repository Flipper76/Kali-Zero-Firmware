# Flipper-Zero-Radio-Scanner

## ðŸ“» Description
Scans frequencies available to the CC1101 and plays them over the speaker so you can hear them.
- Does NOT play "FM radio stations" since those frequencies are not available.

- Currently using FM238 (FuriHalSubGhzPreset2FSKDev238Async) but per CodeAllNight a custom preset can be used to improve audio.
